            <p>Hello, my name is Joseph A Mason. I’m an aspiring Full Stack Developer, for now. My
                continuous
                pursuit of perfecting my craft will only be furthermore empowered with the humbleness I
                will
                maintain throughout my career. Once you feel like you know it all, you know nothing. I am a
                student
                of the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp where the curriculum focuses on not only encompassing
                the
                latest skills in web development based on the job market, but it gives us the core
                components to
                learning coding languages in general. The core components will allow us to learn any
                language of
                code and grasp its concepts.
                I was born and raised in
                Chicago, Ill.
                I moved to Atlanta in January of 2010. For the past 7 years, I’ve advanced within the IT
                field from
                Service Desk Analyst, to now Applications Analyst. Mastering the web development skills I’m
                learning now will advance my career in many ways. I’m excited to move forward in my
                development and
                see where Full Stack Development takes me, or I take it."
